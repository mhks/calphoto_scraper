NAME
	calphotos.py -- Command-line utility to scrape the calphotos website for image links and download them.

SYNOPSIS
	python calphoto.py [csv file] [dest. folder] [--limit] [--log]
	Also view this with 'python calphotos.py -h'
	
DESCRIPTION
	CSV is required.  Should be a single column of plant binomials.  
    Ex.
		adiantum aleuticum
		agrostis idahoensis
		aira caryophyllea
		arabis glabra
		artemisia douglasiana
		asplenium viride
	
    Var.'s and ssp.'s may or may not work, though the calphotos search 
    function seems flexible in this area.
    
    If directory does not exist, it will be created.
    Photos are saved in format 'plant-name0.jpg', 'plant-name1.jpg'... 'plant-name4.jpg'

    (Optional)
    If images are not found, the binomial will be logged to a csv specified on the command line.
    
    The steps required to get the photos:
    	1.) Plant names are read in from csv and formatted to fit the calphotos search url
    	2.) This first url goes to the plant image index page
    	3.) Each thumbnail image is scraped and the link to the larger image is found
    	4.) The url for each large image is constructed.
    	5.) Each large image is downloaded and named accordingly.

TODO:
	Check csv for correct format. One column.
	Better download indicator
	Merge with pac NW wildflowers scraper.  Let user choose which site to scrape.
	Handle folder overwriting?
